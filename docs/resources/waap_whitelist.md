# wangsu_waap_whitelist (Resource)

Use this resource to create a whitelist rule.
This resource allows you to create a whitelist rule.

## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "wangsu_waap_whitelist" "demo" {
 rule_name   = "tf_test_update333"
 domain      = "waap.czp1"
 description = "terraform test update 11"

 conditions {
  path_conditions {
   match_type = "NOT_EQUAL"
   paths      = ["/p11", "/p21"]
  }
  uri_conditions {
   match_type = "NOT_EQUAL"
   uri        = ["/uri11", "/uri21"]
  }
  ua_conditions {
   match_type = "NOT_EQUAL"
   ua         = ["ua11", "ua21"]
  }
  referer_conditions {
   match_type = "NOT_EQUAL"
   referer    = ["re11", "re21"]
  }
  header_conditions {
   match_type = "NOT_EQUAL"
   key        = "h1"
   value_list = ["h111", "h211"]
  }
 }
}

data "wangsu_waap_whitelist" "demo" {
 rule_name   = wangsu_waap_whitelist.demo.rule_name
 domain_list = [wangsu_waap_whitelist.demo.domain]
}
